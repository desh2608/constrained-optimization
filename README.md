## Constrained Optimization

This repository contains Python implementations for some popular
constrained optimization methods. These implementations were
done as part of homework assignments for the course 553.762 taught
by Dr. Donniell Fishkind at Johns Hopkins University during Spring
2020 term. 

Computational efficiency was not a priority for these implementations,
although in most cases, effort has been made to use numpy tricks
for faster computations.

Currently, the following methods have been implemented:
1. [Simplex method (primal and dual) for LP](./simplex/)
2. [Long-step interior point method for QP](./interior_point/)
3. [Penalty method with steepest point for auxiliary problem](./penalty/)
